	<text>송신소에 접근하자 날씬하고 멋지게 차려입은 리치가 화면에 나타나 광고를 했습니다. "안녕하세요 저는 시니어입니다. 그 토니 시니어가 맞습니다! 토니네의 오너죠! 헥타르 산업과의 새로운 파트너십을 소개합니다! 토니네에 들려주세요!" 당신은 분명 오래 전에도 이 광고를 본 적이 있습니다. 이건 전혀 "새로운" 것도 아닐뿐더러 "토니네"는 대형마트 브랜드입니다. 무슨 이유에선지 그들은 이 오래된 광고를 계속해서 내보내고 있지만, 문제 될 건 없죠.</text>
	<text>근처에 "토니네" 정거장이 있는 것 같습니다. 이는 멀티버스에서 가장 규모가 크며 유일하게 리치가 소유한 대형마트입니다. "토니네"의 상점들은 일반적인 상품들 외에도 군용품에 "원예 도구"라는 라벨을 붙여 파는 것으로 악명이 높습니다. </text>
	<text>인터컴에서 이 지역 토니네 상점의 광고가 흘러나왔습니다. "토니네"처럼 거대한 브랜드가 군용품을 취급한다는 건 기묘한 일이지만, 그들이 이식용 장기와 매춘부도 취급하는걸 생각하면 이상할 것도 없습니다.</text>
	<text>"이봐요 형씨들! 여기 토니네 상점에 들려주세요! 우리가 새로운 어... 음... 아무튼 들려주세요!" 설득력 없는 말투였지만, 여기가 뭐 하는 곳인지는 확실히 알 수 있었습니다. 이곳은 미스테리하고 은밀한 리치 재벌이 소유하고 있는 멀티버스 최대의 브랜드 "토니네"의 체인점입니다.</text>
	<text>어딘가로 날아가던 슬러그 함선이 당신을 보고는 멈춰섰습니다. 그 함선의 선장이 근처 토니네 상점에서 판매중인 헥타르제 모듈식 무기에 대한 광고 전단지를 건성으로 건네줬습니다. 슬러그의 태도는 무례했지만 리치 브랜드의 평판을 생각해보면 가볼 가치가 있습니다.</text>
	<text>인근 대형마트에서 송출중인 시엠송이 함내의 음향 장치로 흘러 나왔습니다. "토니네로 오세요! 토니네로 오세요! 와서. 물건을. 사세요."</text>
	<text>화사한 색감에 심플하면서도 특징적인 상표가 이곳이 토니네임을 시사합니다. 악명높은 브랜드인 "토니네"는 좋은 것, 나쁜 것, 그리고 이상한 것까지 수많은 상품을 취급하는 것으로 유명합니다. 이곳의 설립자 토니 시니어에게는 마피아에 연루된 일부터 줄피콰르와 관련된 어두운 과거까지 수많은 괴담들이 떠돕니다. 이 얘기들이 사실인지는 알 수 없지만, 그의 상점은 질 좋은 상품들로 유명하니 둘러볼만한 가치가 있습니다.</text>

	<text>Despite the colorful isles and fascinating trinkets, there isn't much here to excite a mercenary captain like yourself. Though, if you ever need a battery powered tongue trimmer or a complete set of action figures from the hit Leech soap opera "Orfaces of Rilla," you suppose you know where to look.</text>
	<text>There isn't much in the store that interests you, disappointing considering all the tales you've heard of these places. A rather flirtatious Vampweed cashier attempts to get your number, but the bloodstains on her uniform warn you not to give her your time.</text>
	<text>Several alien species roam the stores alongside you, but no one makes any attempts to speak to one another. Not that you could if you wanted to, because the music playing over the intercom is so loud the items on the shelves are vibrating. It's better if you don't stick around in case you lose your hearing.</text>
	<text>A few ancient posters from a long-past Eargen election are still hung up outside. Considering no president has been democratically elected in the Republic for years, it's quite ironic, but a quick chat with the surprisingly friendly staff reveal that it's just become a joke among them. Besides that interaction, there isn't much reason to stick around.</text>
	<text>You stop by the station but don't find anything of interest on sale besides the military supplies. You take a quick detour to the store's bathroom, but the uncomfortable sloshing noises from inside convince you to stay away and just wait until you're back on the ship.</text>

I met with Rig to discuss the terms, when out of nowhere a Slug ship arrived and mind controlled me into sticking myself up Rig's... uh... asshole. The surgeons had no idea how to handle the situation. For 3 years we lived like that, stuck together. I was forced to eat Rig's waste to survive.

	<text>You receive a message meant to degrade you as aliens. You half expect an attack but it seems to have come from a small civilian shuttle.</text>
	<text>No one bothers your ship as you float among numerous space stations and mining platforms. The Rock certainly run efficient operations.</text>
	<text>You arrive and detect signs of battle. A few ships are taking passes at each other near a small station. You don't know if it's a territory issue, a contest or a rite of passage but you decide it's best to stay out of it.</text>
	<text>There's not much at this beacon. Just a few abandoned depots, stripped clean.</text>
	<text>A few freighters pass by but they refuse all communications. Must not want to sully their reputation by talking with foreigners.</text>
	<text>You see a small trading post and ask about refuelling but they respond, "Go away! We don't serve your kind here."</text>
	<text>You see a Zoltan merchant and ask about his wares. He responds, "Sorry, but it took years to gain their trust. I can't be seen communicating with you. I hope you understand." He cuts communications.</text>

	<text>The Rock Elders keep a very strict eye on all of their systems. It seems their authoritarian ways have had a very negative effect on the nearby system, because there isn't a single ship roaming about.</text>
	<text>Despite your very presence in this sector being a crime, no Rock ships stop you. A few civilians linger before jumping away, but you are undisturbed.</text>
	<text>It's a miracle to find an empty beacon here, one free from the brutal enforcers who patrol this sector and the ever hostile citizens.</text>
	<text>You can't remember many tales of the Rock Inquisition from Universe 0, but you're sure just a horribly violent war had terrible causalities on the Rock population. This beacon is unnervingly empty of all life, and you can only wonder if it is a consequence of the warmongering of the Elders' pre-Federation years.</text>
	<text>A Rock patrol orbits around the beacon, but luckily they seem rather laid back. They hail you, "We won't tell if you don't either."</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">A Rock settlement lays far in the distance, but they refuse to respond to any hails. This beacon may as well be empty, because nothing can counter the stubbornness of the Rockmen.</text>

	<text>Either this part of Slug space is deserted, or it's too dense for even Slugs to detect your presence. Time to move.</text>
	<text>This area of the nebula seems entirely empty until a small Slug transport and its escorts emerges suddenly from through the clouds, only to disappear again in a matter of seconds.</text>
	<text>You explore around the beacon and are shocked when a rock the size of a small moon suddenly looms ahead of you. Scans reveal the solid-looking rock is just a husk, almost entirely mined out of useful minerals.</text>
	<text>There are a number of small stations for travellers in the area, lit up by guiding lights and advertisements. Only Slug ships are docked so you decide it's better to avoid a confrontation and steer clear.</text>
