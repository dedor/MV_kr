									<text>The Dread Pirate Tuco, true to what the Outcast claims, is not so much a singular person but rather a title. The original Tuco for which the moniker was derived lived during the days of the archaic Rock-Crystal Empire and fought against Toarde and the other 4 Rock Elders during the collapse of the Empire. While Tuco's side inevitably lost and the Theocracy rose from the ashes of that war, stories of the ventures of Tuco continued to be shared by Rock school-children even after the Elders forbade them from being told. Several Rockmen have picked up the title of Tuco since then, giving the name even more infamy and immortality. The current holder of the title is believed to once have been known as Rowbad, and currently works as a bodyguard for Ocym, the Aquarian co-founder of the Argeonn smuggler clan.</text>

I needn't waste your time which much historical mumble, but in short the Empire has been so tolerant of the SSLG's more radical motions as the Empress sees great benefit in gaining access to Theocracy grounds. We seek access to the Waystone, the device originally used to seal our homeworlds away from the galaxy. At first, we hoped the Lost Suns might retrieve it for us in return for more dedicated support. But now it seems those plans have faltered. Now, I must go at it alone. It will be perilous, but I wonder if you might be up for the task?"</text>

<event name="TURBAN" unique="true">
	<text>Before you is a grand spectacle, a giant sprawling city so tall it blocks out the sun. Massive bridges span artificial ravines with walls lined with store fronts. Half of the city seems to ressemble traditional Rock architecture, but many connected segments are only half complete and are seemingly cobbled together out of scrap metal. This is Turban, one of the largest centers for trade, commerce, and culture in the modern galaxy, created quite ironically from the former site of a Chrysolic Church and Inquisition stronghold.</text>

You also find a number of stores selling military supplies with an incredible variety of items to choose from.</text>

True to his word, only a few turns later and you arrive at a crudely constructed door which you slide out of the way.

My father sat at the table of victors when the Elders divided the Rock-Crystal Empire and seized power, but he was denied a place as an Elder. He warned me that the Elders would not be kind to our heritage unless we continued to prove our loyalty. I served as a Chrysolic priest for many years before I married my wife, Iri.

She was but a young child at the time, but what were we to do? The Rock people hated us, they saw us as exactly what we were. My daughter hated me too, and one day she simply vanished from her room in Toarde's palace along with her brother. Toarde was furious, and he blamed me because he had no one else to blame."</text>

The outcasts who lived here hated me, but I was able to survive by proving my usefulness as a guide through the unexplored halls of the buildings. I had helped in the planning for the original construction of Turban before it was abandoned, you see. After the outcasts had established full control I was allowed to stay, but they began to call me the 'cursed one'. A homeless prophet who wandered the streets claimed that I would bring destruction to this place. And... well, here we are I suppose."</text>

			<text>Argo begins to hum a tune, some old Rock folk-song, but he's interrupted by an announcement over an old radio in the corner of the room. "Attention all those who remain: return to the surface at once and surrender yourselves. Those who have taken refuge in the sewers or ravines will be quickly snuffed out." You remotely check your ship's radar and see a concerningly large new blip appear. Seems the Theocracy has deployed a cruiser vessel of some kind.</text>

You trust them to hold their own this time, but they won't stand a chance unless you can take down that cruiser!

Among them is Argo, carrying a bloodied staff typically carried by priests such as he used to be. "I am in no way qualified to speak in such manners, but I think it goes without saying we people of Turban thank you. We Outcasts never expected the Federation to aid us in such a way. Assuming it has survived the bombardment, you should find a Rock cruiser on the landing pads outside of the city. It belongs to me, but I want you to have it. I must stay here and help repair the city. Turban will stand once again, I am certain of it."</text>
