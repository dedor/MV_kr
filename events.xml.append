	<text>제 1장... 소개!
	멀티버스 모드에 오신 것을 환영합니다! 튜토리얼을 켰다는 건 당신이 이 모드가 처음이라는 말씀이시겠죠! 메타버스 모드는 원본 FTL의 후속작 느낌으로 제작되었습니다. 기본적인 스토리에 대해 알고 싶으시다면, 다음 번 '캐주얼' 또는 '노멀' 난이도 플레이를 시작할 때 "마지막으로 임무 세부사항을 한번 더 확인한다."를 선택하십시오.</text>

			<text>멀티버스는 거대 규모의 모드이며, 많은 추가 요소가 있습니다. 튜토리얼만으로 모든 변경 사항을 망라하긴 어려울 것입니다만, 모드에 쉽게 적응하기 위한 핵심 정보 위주로 소개하겠습니다.
			이번 장에서는 멀티버스 모드에 추가된 세력을 소개하겠습니다. 설명을 건너뛰고 직접 확인해 보고 싶으신 분들은, '넘긴다.'를 누르고 다음 송신소로 이동하십시오!</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>새로 추가된 세력 정보를 확인한다.</text>
				<event>
					<text>앞으로 만나게 될 신규 우호 세력의 간락한 정보를 소개합니다:	
					오키드 군락 - 식물 생명체로 이루어진 평화로운 세력입니다. 오키드 선원은 산소를 만들어내는 능력을 가지고 있어, 질식시키기 매우 어렵습니다. 또한 오키드는 종종 100% 확률로 선체 파쇄를 일으키는 미사일 무기인 "낱알 포"를 사용합니다.
					독립 맨티스 - 어딘가 모자라 보이지만 매우 친근한 맨티스 종파입니다. 매우 강력한 강습선에 탑승하지만, 당신이 적대 행동을 할 때에만 반격해 올 것입니다. 그 외에는 당신을 매우 기쁘게 맞이할 것입니다.
					민병대 - 민병대는 시민 구역을 지키기 위해 결성된 자원 부대입니다. 연방 동맹의 구성원인 우주 연합의 하위 단체로서, 그들 앞에서 위법을 저지르지 않는 한 방해하지 않을 것입니다.
					셸 천재정- 셸 종족은 보통 성운 지대에 은거하며 과학 연구를 주요 관심사로 삼습니다. 셸 선원은 많은 양의 산소를 필요로 하지만, 그들의 함선은 강력한 방어를 자랑합니다.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">

							<text>앞으로 만나게 될 신규 중립 세력의 간락한 정보를 소개합니다:
							엔지 분리주의자 - 엔지 분리주의자들은 그들을 지배하던 통일된 '하모니'에서 해방된 분파입니다. 연방과의 지속적인 반목 때문에 보통 혼자 있기를 선호합니다. 극단적인 경우로 함선에 겨우 1-2명 밖에 승선하지 않은 경우도 있습니다!
							로스트 선 - 락맨의 분파 중 하나인 로스트 선 동맹은 엄밀히 따지자면 연방과 동맹 관계이기는 하지만, 호전적이고 불을 광신합니다. 현재 권위주의적인 락맨 원로 세력과 내전 중입니다.
							고스트 - 고스트라고 부르지만 영적인 존재가 아닙니다. 사실은 성운 지대의 가스 물질이 모여 이루어진 생물의 일종입니다. 고스트은 우주의 정치 논리 따위엔 관심이 없습니다. 주로 버려진 함선의 잔해에서 되는 대로 살아갑니다.
							외계 생명체 사냥 길드(EHG) - EHG는 슬러그족의 단체로, 취미 또는 직업 사냥꾼들의 동호회입니다. 그들은 특별한 사냥감을 원합니다. 바로 지적 생명체죠. 그렇다곤 해도, 모든 종족의 관광객들을 환대하며, 연방에 딱히 적의는 가지고 있지 않습니다.</text>

									연합 - 락맨 신정, 슬러그 도둑정, 맨티스 하이브, 크리스탈 제국의 공격적이고도 불안정한 동맹입니다. 동맹을 이루는 네 구성 종족의 일반 전술을 골고루 사용합니다.
									더스크브링어 - 졸탄 시민들의 급격한 지지를 받고 있는 졸탄 테러리스트 단체입니다. 더스크브링어는 전투에서 주로 자폭 돌격을 감행합니다. 잘만 활용하면 그들끼리 서로 폭발에 휘말리게 할 수 있습니다.
									반군 공병대 - 반군 함대의 하위 구성원으로 대부분의 반군 무인기를 운용합니다. 일반적으로 고성능 무장과 함선을 운용하지만, 자주 나타나지 않으며 반군을 맹목적으로 따르는 편도 아닙니다.</text>
									<choice hidden="true">

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>계속...</text>
		<event>
			<text>에너지 포
			에너지 무기는 초록색 불빛이 인상적인 무기입니다. 에너지 무기는 선체 피해와 이온 피해를 동시에 입히지만, 시설 피해와 선원 피해를 전혀 입히지 않습니다. 화재를 일으킬 확률도 적당히 있습니다!</text>
			<weapon name="ENERGY_1"/>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>계속...</text>
				<event>
					<text>입자 무기
					이 오렌지색 무기는 레이저 또는 미사일 무장으로 등장하며, 선체나 선원에 피해를 입힐 수 없습니다. 안티-바이오 무장과는 달리 시설에 큰 피해를 입히며, 화재를 일으킬 확률이 높습니다.</text>
					<weapon name="LASER_PARTICLE"/>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>계속...</text>
						<event>
							<text>핀포인트 빔
							핀포인트 빔은 일반 빔 무기와 비슷하게 작동합니다. 절대로 빗나가지 않으며 공격력 수치만큼 실드를 관통하고 피해가 줄어듭니다. 일반 빔 무기에 비해 전력 대비 피해량이 강력하지만, 그 대가로 단 하나의 방만 공격할 수 있습니다! 적함이 이 무기를 탑재한 경우는 많지 않지만, 어쩌다 한번 보게 될지도 모릅니다.</text>
							<weapon name="FOCUS_1"/>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>계속...</text>
								<event>
									<text>보존 무기
									보존 무기는 다른 무기와는 달리 전력을 소모하지 않습니다. 하지만 다른 무기나 졸탄을 통해 전력을 공급받아야 사용할 수 있습니다. 보존 무기는 무기실에 전력이 공급되지 않더라도 공격을 "충전"해 두었다가, 전력이 동급되면 한 번에 공격을 발사할 수 있습니다. 적들은 절대로 이 무기를 사용하지 않습니다.</text>
									<weapon name="LASER_CONSERVATIVE"/>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>계속...</text>
										<event>
											<text>재활용 무기
											재활용 무기는 탄약을 사용하는 무기와 비슷하지만, 탄약을 사용하지 않고도 발사할 수 있습니다! 미사일을 사용하지 않는 대가로 더 긴 시간 충전해야만 합니다. 마찬가지로 적들은 절대로 이 무기를 사용하지 않습니다.</text>
											<weapon name="MISSILES_FREE"/>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>계속...</text>
												<event>
													<text>기뢰 사출기
													기뢰 사출기 계열은 다른 모드에서도 많이 등장한 무기입니다. 멀티버스 모드에서는 기뢰가 시설 피해도 입힐 수 있습니다만, MK2와 3은 시설 피해가 줄어듭니다. 또한 빈 송신소에서 기뢰를 매설하여 반군의 진격을 늦출 수도 있습니다. 기뢰함을 잡거나 희귀한 이벤트를 통해 얻을 수 있습니다. 기뢰함만 이 무기를 사용합니다.</text>
													<weapon name="MINELAUNCHER_1"/>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>계속...</text>
														<event>
															<text>낱알 포
															마지막으로, 오키드 종족의 주력 무장인 낱알 포입니다. 미사일 계열 무기들처럼 탄약을 사용하고 실드를 모두 관통하지만, 더욱 강력하고 반드시 선체 파쇄를 일으킵니다. 낱알 포 무기는 오키드 함선, 해적 오키드 함선, 또는 오키드 구역에서 얻을 수 있습니다.</text>

	<text>제 3장... 드론!
	멀티버스 모드에서 대분의 드론이 정리되었습니다. 사실 여러분이 보게 될 드론은 대부분 처음 보게 될 것인지도 모르겠습니다. 대부분은 전투 시작 전 모드를 "전환"할 수 있는 드론으로 통합됐습니다. 또한 추가 전력을 대가로 성능을 향상시킬 수 있는 "증폭" 드론도 있습니다. 나머지는 여러 가지 기능을 수행하는 승선 드론입니다.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>계속...</text>
		<event>
			<text>토글 드론
			이 드론은 (매우 특수한 경우를 제외하면) 두 가지 모드를 전환할 수 있는 드론입니다. 모드 전환은 전투 시작 전에만 가능하며, 전투 중에는 전환할 수 없습니다. 적의 장비를 잘 보고 결정하세요! 두 모드의 자원이나 전력 소모는 같습니다. 토글 드론을 가진 적은 플레이어 처럼 하나의 모드로 고정되며 전투 중 전환하지 않습니다.</text>
			<drone name="GUARDIAN_1_MISSILE"/>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>계속...</text>
				<event>
					<text>앰프 드론
					앰프 드론은 토글 드론처럼 전투 전에 설정할 수 있습니다. 하지만 토글 드론과는 달리, 앰프 드론은 사용 전력을 조절합니다. 전력을 더 소모하면 피해량이 증가하지만 더 느리게 이동합니다. 현재 상황에 맞는 전력을 고르세요. 일찍 드론을 획득하고 진행에 맞게 출력을 강화하세요!</text>
					<drone name="ENERGY_1_AMP2"/>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>계속...</text>
						<event>
							<text>승선 드론
							승선 드론은 본편의 승선 드론과 비슷하다고 할 수 있습니다! 멀티버스 모드에서는 다양한 기능을 하는 승선 드론이 여럿 추가되었습니다만, 본질적으로 다른 점이 하나 생겼습니다. 이제 모든 승선 드론은 플레이어가 직접 조작합니다! 지금 주어진 것처럼 몇몇 승선 드론은 보존 드론입니다. 보존 무기와는 다르게 다른 드론을 가동하지 않아도 되며, 드론 제어 시스템이 꺼지거나 파괴되어도 작동합니다. 하지만 한번 켜면 수동 정지할 수 없습니다.</text>
							<drone name="MANNING"/>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>계속...</text>
								<event>
									<text>무기와는 다르게, 본편에서 등장한 드론은 극히 일부를 제외하고 위에서 소개한 계열로 편입되거나 삭제되었습니다. 디펜스 드론을 제외한 다른 모든 것들을 상점에 즉시 판매하던 것보다는 활용하기 좋을 것이라고 믿고 있습니다.
									
									여기까지 제 3장이었습니다. 다음 송신소로 이동하여 보조장비에 대한 설명을 들으십시오. 지금 받으신 드론을 충분히 시험해 본 후 상점에서 모든 장비를 팔고 이동하면 됩니다.</text>

	<text>제 4장... 보조장비!
	보조장비 또한 드론처럼 본편에서 볼 수 있던 것들이 대부분 삭제되고, 멀티버스 모드에 도입된 '내부 업그레이드' 시스템에 편입되었습니다. 내부 업그레이드에 대한 설명은 뒤에서 보실 수 있습니다. 제 4장에서는 멀티버스 모드에 추가된 새로운 보조장비 유형(특히 전투 보조장비)에 대해 소개하겠습니다.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>계속...</text>
		<event>
			<text>전투 보조장비
			다른 모드를 해 보신 분들이라면 전투 보조장비가 익숙하실 겁니다. 하지만 멀티버스 모드에서 좀 더 다듬어졌습니다. 전투 보조장비들은 전투 직전에 사용할 수 있으며, 전투 중 지속해서 효과를 제공합니다. 대부분은 플레이어의 전력을 사용하여 적의 지정된 적의 시스템을 무력화합니다. 보조장비는 특정 인카운터에서 별도로 명시된 것이 아닌 한 반드시 효과를 볼 수 있습니다.</text>
			<augment name="COMBAT_WEAPON_JAMMER"/>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>계속...</text>
				<event>
					<text>외장 보조장비
					외장 보조장비는 앞서 언급한 내장 보조장비와 직접 연관된 종류입니다. 기능적으로 대응되는 본편 보조장비와 동일한 효과를 가지지만, 빈 송신소에서 무료로 내부 업그레이드로 바꿀 수 있습니다. 초기 장비로 지급되는 것 외에는 자주 등장하지 않지만, 확정으로 얻을 수 있는 이벤트가 몇 개 있습니다.</text>
					<augment name="EX_ION_ARMOR"/>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>계속...</text>
						<event>
							<text>초광속 보조장비
							Multiverse adds several new types with different uses, but there's another crucial change. All crew drones are now controlled by the player, rather than acting autonomously! Some drones, as the one given here, are also conservative. Unlike conservative weapons, conservative drones do NOT need another drones to be powered (and even work if the drone system is damaged or destroyed), but cannot be deactivated manually.</text>
							<drone name="MANNING"/>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>계속...</text>
								<event>
									<text>Unlike with weapons, most drones from vanilla do not appear in Multiverse. With a few special exceptions, every drone falls into one or more of the categories mentioned here. Hopefully you'll find yourself enjoying using the new drones, rather than selling everything that isn't a defense drone at the nearest store.
									
									This concludes part 3. Continue to the next beacon to proceed with the tutorial, which will cover augments. It is recommended you take a look at the drones given here, then sell any equipment on your ship at this store so you can fit all of the augments given to you.</text>

	<text>THE RENEGADE COLLECTION
	Developed by: Kix
	Currently Disabled.
	
	An equipment expansion pack meant to be used alongside Multiverse. Includes many various weapon and drone concepts considered, for one reason or another, unfitting for the base mod. While attempting to be balanced, due to the nature of the equipment in this pack as well as the fact it is not part of base Multiverse means there may be a higher variation of balance than usual. The new weapons include those that are niche, too conceptually similar to existing weapons, involve "hard-to-balance" gimmicks, or are just conceptually bizarre.
	
	To enable the Renegade Collection, go to the subset forums and visit the MV addon page!</text>
